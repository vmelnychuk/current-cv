## xml to pdf from browser
*idea:* the source of CV is stored in XML format. there is XSL style that transformed it to HTML and then is pronted to PDF form broeser e.g. GC or FF.
Also there is configuration for CV, to show only relevant parts.

*As part of testing note:* this http-server on node.js as workaround of CORS.
